*Our team hand select your matches and accompany you throughout the entire process of finding your success match, from the caraterization of your preference to the choice of your soulmate.*

We aim to adress the binding problem enconter by huge amount of kinases in the Kinome. 
Nowadays despite huge effort in binding reserch, finding good matche for kinase remain a open problem. 


Our *mantra* : 
 - Kinase the master pieces: For those very busy and important protein class in the vast Proteom, 
kinase are the ones that contribute the most to human operations (thanks for them) and their disfunctions underly several diseases. We must take care of them.
 - Overwelm kinase: Kinase are averywere and everyone is reaching them, hard to find the good one
 - Match shifting: Kinase enconter problem to keep their match for themself (Off target)

Among all of you we can notice that binding is essentially according to IC50 but we must not ignore the other factors!

> **KI: The big boss** \
>It's the indication of how potent an ligand is on you. It exactly is the quantity of (chemestry)/(alchemy) required to produce half maximum (inhibition)/(fall head over heels). Which is very interesting for us: If we know what make you fall half in love we will know the perfect factore to make you fall in love completely.

>**IC50: Nice insight** \
>Represent the Half-maximal inhibitory concentration, it's computed on special situation where the quantity of (chemestry)/(alchemy) is tightly controled.  It can say a lot but i very define situation. It will not give us the objectif and intemporell match that you need but we need an objective measure that will not depend on the situation. The solution : **KI**

>**IC50 vs KI: bigbro forever** \
Hopfully both are statistically linked so we can still orient our research by using both of them dpending again of you!

> **Temperature and pH rising for your match** \
> Even if the temperature or the pH cannot by them self represent a binding factore we know that they can influence a lot your match. So let the temerature rising and trust your pH! 


> So yes, you don't seems to accrod a lot of attention to the others so lets negelct them

# What's make a good candidate
We have selected for you many many many candidate!
Let's have a look at them and see what can we leanrt about they (chemestry)/(alchemy).

## 1. The categories 
Different skills and fonctionnalities for different match.

## 2. Their weights 

## 3. Their logP


>Okok like that we don't see anything, lets find better features for our selection, lets draw a spacial space of selection!
